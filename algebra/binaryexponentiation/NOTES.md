### Applications :

- Compute $`x^n % m`$
- Compute $`n^{th}`$ Fibonacci number $`F_{n}`$
- You are given a sequence of length n. Apply to it a given permutation k times.
- Given n points $`p_{i}`$, apply $`m`$ transformations to each of these points. 
  Each transformation can be a shift, a scaling, or a rotation around a given axis by a given angle.
  There is also a "loop" operation which applies a given list of transformations $`k`$ times.
- Given a directed unweighted graph of $`n`$ vertices, find the number of paths of length $`k`$ from any vertex $`u`$ 
  to any other vertex $`v`$.
- Multiply two numbers `a` and `b` modulo `m`. `a` and `b` fit in the built-in data types, 
  but their product is too big to fit in a 64-bit integer.
  The idea is to compute `a â‹… b (mod m)` without using big num arithmetics.
